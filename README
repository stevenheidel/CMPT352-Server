Fairly straightforward, just run as a web application and then go to localhost:8888.

All servlets are in src/ under the cmpt352server package. JSPs and static files are in the war/ directory, along with .xml config files.

---Status---
- allows registration of users and manual entry of IMEI, UUID, and phone number
- allows simple login using QR code as second step

---TODO---
- 60 database queries per user is probably not the best
- error checking and encryption
- better session tracking to make sure people are logged in at right points
- registration system and login API for the android app to register
- thorough testing
- beautifying
- perhaps test system where just 1 step with only QR code
- Probably more stuff...
